Hi I'm Cam. I'm an Equity Derivatives Trader from Sydney, Australia. I've been based in London for the last 2 years after spending nearly 10 years living in Cape Town, South Africa. 

I love trading and throughout my career I have traded multiple strategies included index vol, single stock vol, index arb and prop strategies such as pairs trading and momentum strategies. Although for work I've only ever traded equities, I have an interest in all asset classes including commodities, fixed income and alternative classes such as cryptocurrency. For my Master in Finance thesis I researched systematic approaches to asset allocation and analysed a simple but effective trend following approach before improving it with my own ideas which included adding bitcoin as an alternative asset class.

My other passion is coding. I chose software development and design as a subject in high school and since then I have always enjoyed programming. I've learnt multiple languages including VBA, R, Python and Go as well as HTML, CSS and SQL (if they can be called languages). I love learning and challenging myself to build new tools and apps - in another life I think I would have chosen to become a full stack developer. I'm analytical and hate black boxes and wherever possible I try to build and model an idea from first principles to fully understand how it works. Coding has complemented my trading, allowing me to analyse large sets of data and build tools to identify trading opportunities.

Other than trading and coding, I enjoy keeping fit, travelling and enjoying good food and wine with my wife. We have two beautiful children and I hope one day that I'll be able to help them learn to code and/or trade financial markets.
